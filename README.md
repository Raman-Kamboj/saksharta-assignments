indoor.py
WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should remain unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.


Hints:
Recall that input returns a str, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.
Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.


playback.py
Some people have a habit of speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, just like YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.
In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ‘...’ (i.e., three periods).
Hints:
Recall that input returns a str, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.
Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.
